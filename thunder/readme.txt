Additionals:

1.	We designed a toughtfull levels to play, 
	they not overly difficult, but we hope you will enjoy it :)
2.	We added colors to the game. If you prefer a simpler look,
	you can easily turn off colors in the main menu.
3.  we added a bit of physics to the blocks, you can push blocks off the ship "back"
    if you push them to a wall or if another ship pushes them (given that the other ship can push them).
